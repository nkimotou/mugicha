## Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used for developing a variety of applications, including system software, game development, and high-performance applications. This section provides an overview of C++ and helps you set up your development environment.

### What is C++?

C++ is an extension of the C programming language with added features such as classes and objects, making it an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Learn about its history, key features, and why it is a popular choice for developers.

### Key Features and Advantages

Explore the features that make C++ a preferred language for many applications, including performance, flexibility, and the ability to use both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Follow the step-by-step guide in the [Development Environment Setup](dev-environment-setup.md) document to configure your system for C++ programming.

## C++ Basics

This section covers the foundational elements of C++, including syntax, variables, and control flow statements. If you're new to programming, these topics will provide a solid understanding to build upon.

### Syntax and Structure

Understand the basic syntax rules and structure of C++ programs. Learn how to write simple programs and organize your code.

### Variables and Data Types

Explore the various data types in C++, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Discover how to declare and use variables effectively.

### Control Flow Statements

Master the control flow statements, including conditional statements (if, else), loops (while, for), and switch statements. Learn how to control the flow of your program's execution.

## Object-Oriented Programming in C++

C++ is renowned for its support of object-oriented programming. In this section, delve into the principles of OOP and how they are implemented in C++.

### Classes and Objects

Learn about classes and objects, the building blocks of object-oriented programming. Understand how to create and use classes to model real-world entities.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Explore inheritance, polymorphism, and other advanced OOP concepts. Understand how to create class hierarchies and leverage polymorphism for flexible and modular code.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction

Discover the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction, essential for creating maintainable and scalable software. Learn how to hide implementation details and expose only the necessary information.

## Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial in C++. This section covers pointers, references, dynamic memory allocation, and smart pointers.

### Pointers and References

Understand the concept of pointers and references, including how to use them for efficient memory manipulation and access.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Learn about dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using operators such as `new` and `delete`. Understand the importance of managing memory in your programs.

### Smart Pointers

Explore smart pointers, a modern C++ feature that helps manage memory automatically and reduces the risk of memory leaks.

## Standard Template Library (STL)

The STL provides a collection of template classes and functions that greatly enhance C++ programming. This section covers essential aspects of the STL.

### Containers and Iterators

Discover the various containers (vectors, lists, maps) and iterators provided by the STL. Learn how to use them effectively in your programs.

### Algorithms

Explore the powerful algorithms provided by the STL for common operations on containers. Enhance your understanding of algorithmic efficiency.

### Strings and Input/Output

Learn how to manipulate strings in C++ and understand the input/output facilities provided by the standard library.
